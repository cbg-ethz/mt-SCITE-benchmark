# Learning the error rate using different metrics

1) Tree Likelihood
2) Log Likelihood Ratio
3) Thresholded Log Likelihood Ratio (local)
4) Thresholded Log Likelihood Ratio (global)
5) Quotient of Log Likelihoods
6) Product of Log Likelihoods

Each is computed by the respective function pick_best_error_rate_[number].py and
generates the files best_learned_tree_[number].py
